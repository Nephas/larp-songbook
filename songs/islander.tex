[Intro]

 Em Em9 C D C D Em


[Verse]

Em                     Em9
An old man by a seashore
 C
 At the end of day
 D          C
 Gazes the horizon
 D                     Em
 With seawinds in his face
 Em                Em9
 Tempest-tossed island
 C
 Seasons all the same
 D          C
 Anchorage unpainted
 D                   Em
 And a ship without a name
 Em              Em9         C
 Sea without a shore for the banished one unheard
 D                C                   D       Em
 He lightens the beacon, light at the end of world
 Em          Em9  C
 Showing the way lighting hope in their hearts
 D                   C              D     Em
 The ones on their travels homeward from afar


[Chorus]

 Em           C    G D Em
 This is for long-forgotten
 C            G          Am Em
 Light at the end of the world
 C   G    D  Em
 Horizon crying
 C                  G        Am
 The tears he left behind long ago


[Intro]

 Em Em9 C D C D Em


[Verse]

  Em                Em9
 The albatross is flying
 C
 Making him daydream
  D                C
 The time before he became
  D                Em
 One of the world's unseen
 Em               Em9
 Princess in the tower
  C
 Children in the fields
 D          C
 Life gave him it all:
 D                Em
 An island of the universe
 Em                   Em9
 Now his love's a memory
  C
 A ghost in the fog
 D                 C
 He sets the sails one last time
  D                    Em
 Saying farewell to the world
  Em            Em9
 Anchor to the water
 C
 Seabed far below
  D            C
 Grass still in his feet
  D                    Em
 And a smile beneath his brow


[Chorus]

 Em           C   G  D Em
 This is for long-forgotten
 C             G         Am Em
 Light at the end of the world
 C   G   D  Em
 Horizon crying
 C                  G         Am
 The tears he left behind so long ago
