[Verse]

Am          G
Now You all know,
Em7                 Am
The bards and their songs.
Am                   G
When hours have gone by,
Em7            Am
I'll close my eyes.
Am              G
In a world far away,
Em7          Am
We may meet again.
Am              G
But now hear my song,
          Em7         Dm
About the dawn of the night.
      C    G   Am     G        C  G  Am  G
Let's sing the bards' song..



[Refrain]

  Dm Am       Dm      Am
Tomorrow will take us away,
Dm       Am
Far from home,
Dm          F    G        Dm
No one will ever know our names,
    Am               G      Am
But the bards' songs will remain.
  Dm Am       Dm       Am
Tomorrow will take it away,
    Dm        Am
The fear of today,
           F
It will be gone,
    C  G         Em
Due to our magic songs.


[Verse]

Am               G
There's only one song,
Em7         Am
Left in my mind.
Am               G
Tales of a brave man,
Em7         Am
Who lived far from here.
Am                     G
Now the bard songs are over,
Em7              Am
And it's time to leave.
Am              G              Em7         Dm
No one should ask You for the name Of the one,.
     C    G   Am G   C  G   Am G
Who tells the story.


[Refrain]

  Dm Am       Dm      Am
Tomorrow will take us away,
Dm       Am
Far from home,
Dm          F    G        Dm
No one will ever know our names,
    Am               G      Am
But the bards' songs will remain.
 Dm  Am     Dm        Am
Tomorrow all will be known,
     Dm         Am
And You're not alone,
   Dm        F
So don't be afraid,
        G       Dm
In the dark and cold,
          Am             G      Am
'Cause the bards' songs will remain,
     C     G     Am
They all will remain.


[Outro]

C     G            Am
In my thoughts and in my dreams,
        C      G     Am
They're always in my mind,
      C        G        Am
These songs of hobbits, dwarves and men,
C
And elves,
     G          Am
Come close Your eyes..
        C   G     Em7
You can see them, too..
